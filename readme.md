# Aurora Project

## Description

This is a simulator for a 16bit stack machine computer based on TTL chips. Inspired by Ben Eater 8bit breadboard computer.
This project container an emulator, a very simple assembler, a compiler for a C-like small lang called (C--), and a desktop app for emulating.

## Features

16bit size word, with a memory of 64k for address space.
Contains an ALU based of the 74LS181 chip that allows for basic logic and arimethic operations.
Half of the memory space is reserved for a 128x128 display.
